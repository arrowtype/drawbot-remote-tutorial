# Using Drawbot in an external editor

This is a set of Python I use many times I wish to make an animation or multipage doc with Drawbot, but code in my preferred editor (currently, VS Code) rather than in the Drawbot app.

## Usage

First, install DrawBot as a module:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/typemytype/drawbot
```

Adapt as needed. Run in the command line with:

```
python3 <path>/remote-drawbot-script-template.py
```
